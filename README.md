# ComiCompanion-App


# Synopsis:
The ComiCompanion App was my solo project at Prime Digital Academy. It is a simple and easy way for any avid comic book reader to track which comics they need to buy. Once purchased the comic issues get moved over to a separate reading list to track and maintain a reader's backlog. Then once read, the user rates each specific issue and it stores in a history log with an average rating for each series.


# Motivation:
For many fans of buying and reading comic books, new comic book wednesday is one of the best days of the week. However, if you just go to a comic book store without a game plan it is very easy to get lost in the sea of bookshelves and racks of books and books. This app allows what used to be a messy scribbled down shopping list, to be neatly organized with a clean electronic shopping list. Not only that, but also as a collector there is the issue of buying more and more books/comics that then stack up in a back log of what you have yet to read. The ComiCompanion also tracks that backlog and what you have or haven't read yet, allowing you to rate individual issues to add to the overall rating for the series to reference if you're not sure if you want to continue buying/reading a series in the future.
