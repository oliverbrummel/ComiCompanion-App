# ComiCompanion-App


# Synopsis:
The ComiCompanion App was my solo project at Prime Digital Academy. It is a simple and easy way for any avid comic book reader to track which comics they need to buy. Once purchased the comic issues get moved over to a separate reading list to track and maintain a reader's backlog. Then once read, the user rates each specific issue and it stores in a history log with an average rating for each series.
